Hello, Hola, Guten Tag, Ciao, Bonjour, Szia and Xin Cháo, fellow citizens of the world, travel enthusiasts and travellers to be.

We are very happea (:wink:) to welcome you on our blog, which we created to share our experiences, adventures and a bunch of travel tips with all of you, who happen to visit places, that we have visited in the past year already, or to take you live on one of our current adventures with us.

Humbly, I assume you might want to know how we are able to do what we are doing and how we got here in the first place. 

Well, a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…

Ok, actually it was not in a galaxy far, far away and also not such a long time ago but more like London area about a year and a bit, that Jayphen and Ina met in Battersea Park playing frisbee, drinking beers and wine and were inseparable ever since. 

Jayphen, who’s originally from Sydney, Australia was travelling Europe already at that time, staying in London for a couple of months, working remotely as a designer and developer for an Australian start up. 
Ina who has her origins in Austria (and a hell of a lot of Eastern European roots) studied in the UK and just started her second year of working for a production company in London as a designer and animator. 

However, it was not easy at the beginning to stay inseparable, since Jayphen was travelling around Europe and Ina tried to visit him as much as she could afford with her annual leave days (usually every second week, booking a long weekend off). Because let’s be honest it’s nicer to go to Paris, Zürich, Split or Iceland on a weekend than spending £5 for a pint in London and everybody who’s been there knows, you need at least three to make you forget it’s always cloudy. 

After about a year, Ina got the chance to work remotely for her London based company and was finally able to join Jayphen on his adventure and here we are now. Travelling the world together and trying to stay for at least a month or two in each country to really suck in all the breath taking impressions, the wide variety of different cultures and more often than not the food that all those beautiful countries have to offer to their citizens of the world.

If you have more questions about us or our life style please feel free to leave us a comment or drop us a private message anytime and until then: HAPPEA TRAVELS :tada:
